		<p>Hello, I'm Julie Ryckelynck. It is my very first year in IESEG in la Défense. I like my friends, animals, and travels. Discover me.</p>

		<h2>FRIENDS</h2>
			<p>I love hanging out with my friends, they are the best. They are the only ones able to get me into a better mood when I’m not fine. The best activity to do with them is a chill evening with wine, music and gossips.</p>

		<h2>ANIMALS</h2>
		<p>I have always loved animals. My favorite animal is the horse. I’ve been riding horses for 12 years. I also have a dog whose name is Daikiris. She is an Australian shepherd and she is 11 years old. I love coming home to see her.</p>

		<h2>TRAVELS</h2>
			<p>I have travelled in a lot of countries. I love travelling. My favorite part of travelling is discovering new food, local food, even though I am picky for food. Since I love animals, my favorite trip was my safari in Namibia.</p>
